# Diabetes Prevalence Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes diabetes prevalence and associated risk factors across six countries: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The analysis uses R to explore trends in diabetes prevalence from 2011 to 2024, with projections for 2050, and investigates relationships with risk factors (obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension) and socioeconomic factors (urbanization, GDP per capita). The project includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analyses to identify patterns and insights.

## Datasets
The project uses three datasets stored in the `Data` subfolder:
- **`africa_uae_diabetes.csv`**: Contains diabetes prevalence data for 2011, 2024, and 2050 (projected), along with undiagnosed case percentages and mortality attributable to diabetes.
- **`risk_factors.csv`**: Includes prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, and hypertension for each country.
- **`worldbank_socio.csv`**: Provides socioeconomic indicators, including urbanization percentage and GDP per capita (in USD).

## Files
- **Data/**
  - `africa_uae_diabetes.csv`: Diabetes prevalence and related metrics.
  - `risk_factors.csv`: Risk factor data (obesity, inactivity, hypertension).
  - `worldbank_socio.csv`: Socioeconomic data (urbanization, GDP per capita).
- **`obesity_diabetes_plot.R`**: R script to generate a scatterplot visualizing the relationship between obesity prevalence and diabetes prevalence (2024), with a regression line and country labels.
- **Outputs** (generated by running scripts, not all uploaded):
  - `diabetes_summary_table.html`: Summary table of dataset statistics (mean and standard deviation).
  - `diabetes_trends_plot.png`: Line plot of diabetes prevalence trends (2011, 2024, 2050).
  - `correlation_plot.png`: Scatterplot matrix of diabetes prevalence and risk/socioeconomic factors.
  - `full_data_merged.csv`: Merged dataset combining all three input datasets.
- **`.gitignore`**: Excludes R-specific temporary files (e.g., `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Rproj`).

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need R and the following R packages:
- `readr`: For reading CSV files.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
- `ggplot2`: For creating visualizations.
- `ggrepel`: For non-overlapping labels in plots.
- `gt`: For formatting tables.
- `gtsummary`: For generating summary statistics.
- `GGally`: For correlation matrix visualizations.
- `corrplot`: For numerical correlation matrices.

Install these packages in R using:
```R
install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggrepel", "gt", "gtsummary", "GGally", "corrplot"))
